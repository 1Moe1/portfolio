									<h2> About Me</h2>
									
									<p>	Hello, I'm Mohammed Mawlod and I'm a GIS/RS Analyst & 
									Research Assistant. I'm passionate about utilizing 
									spatial data and analytics to address the challenges 
									and make a positive impact. I have acquired and developed
									a broad and varied range of skills in spatial analysis,
									mapping, modeling through my work. Projects in environmental
									analysis, groundwater exploration, water harvesting, mineral exploration,
									precision agriculture and public health have been part of my
									work. I've also drafted technical proposals, given GIS
									technical assitance to reseachers, and communicated
									findings to non-technical audiences.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Prediction of Malaria Hotspots Using GIS/RS, South Khartoum
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<img src="images/project-1.png" alt="" class="image fit"/>
									
									<p>Mosquito-borne diseases yield a huge burden of disease around the world
										 and lead to about 700 million cases and 1 million deaths 
										 from mosquito-borne diseases each year. <br>
										 The motivation for this is to predict potential mosquito breeding sites
										  to combat malaria in the study area (South Khartoum Locality). 
										  The results of the study can be extremely significant in directing efforts 
										  for malaria control. It can also make it possible to deploy
										   resources effectively, concentrating on awareness-raising initiatives
										    and evaluating the effectiveness of interventions.

									<img src="images/GWPZ_Final._Alt_Color.jpg" alt="" class="image fit"/>
									<img src="images/3D.2.jpg" alt="" class="image fit"/>
									<p>Groundwater is a vital natural resource, and mapping of potential zones can assist in sustainable water resource management. <br>
										This project aimed to use GIS and RS to identify groundwater potential zones in Khartoum North. By integrating multiple geospatial datasets
										 and analyzing key indicators, such as land cover, geology, slope, drainage density, lineament density, TWI, NDVI, rainfall, soil, distance
										  to rivers and existing water wells data. <br>A map that highlights
										 areas with potential for groundwater availability was generated. This kind of maps can contribute to sustainable water resource management and aid in making
										  informed decisions regarding groundwater utilization.

									<p> As spectral reflectance and signature analysis can help 
										identify variations in rock types and mineral assemblages,
										 the utilization of GIS and RS in the exploration of minerals 
										 has gained a lot of popularity lately. This is because it can 
										 give important insights into geological features without the need
										  for extensive fieldwork. <br> The purpose of the study was to investigate
										   how to use GIS and RS to map and assess prospective gold-bearing areas 
										   in El-Sherik, Sudan. A detailed evaluation of the potential for gold 
										   in the study area can be obtained by combining geological sampling, 
										   field observations, and satellite images.</p>

									<p>
										Water harvesting is a practice that aims to collect, store, and use runoff
										 or rainwater from various sources for beneficial purposes. <br> The aim of this study was to 
										 locate the best location for a small dam for capturing both rainwater and floodwater. For
										  selecting the best location, a variety of factors, including topography, land cover, rainfall
										   patterns, and hydrological features, were analyzed. <br>
										   GIS and RS can act as a guide for stakeholders by aiding in planning and management, 
										   which can result in improving local water security.

									<img src="images/BN_Zoom.png" alt="" class="image fit"/>
									<p>Floods are the most frequent type of disasters. Although they can be predicted, they often cause a massive damage and destruction. <br>
										In September 2020, following continous and intense rainfall in North-Eastern Africa, Sudan experienced one of the worst floods in its history.
										This project aimed to analyze the floods that occurred in Khartoum, specifically in the Blue Nile and White
										 Nile rivers. This project sought to understand these floods, highlight their extent, and evaluate their impact.</p>

									<img src="images/ozone.png" alt="" class="image fit"/>
									<p>Ozone buildup is a serious environmental issue that has repercussions for both human health and the long-term viability of the environment. <br>
										The motivation of this study was to explore the potential relationship between ozone buildup, household income, and elevation in the state of California.

										Based on the analysis of data on air quality, elevation, and census tracts with income, it has been found that higher altitude areas frequently have greater
										 ozone concentration levels and that higher income areas also tend to have somewhat higher ozone concentration levels.

								<img src="images/flood prone areas.jpg" alt=""  class="image fit"/>
								
								<p> Nature, infrastructure, and communities are all seriously at risk from floods events. However, by combining geospatial techniques like RS and GIS,
									 early warning systems can be set up to deliver early alerts. <br>
									This project's goal was to identify flood-prone zones in Khartoum, which occasionally experiences flooding. For this study, a number of factors were used, including rainfall, elevation,
									 land use, slope, the distance from streams, and historical flood records.This study produced a flood hazard map that indicates areas prone to floods. This map can help in making effective 
									 decisions on emergency preparedness.</p>

								<p>Accurate elevation data is crucial for a wide range of applications, from urban planning 
									to environmental analysis. By conducting a comparative analysis, we aim to provide valuable
									 insights into the variations and nuances between these two datasets.
									<br> A Comparative Study with SRTM Data aimed to gain valuable insights into the differences in
									 elevation between SRTM DEMs and DEMs generated from  contour lines of topographic maps.
									 the study revealed significant differences in elevation between the SRTM DEMs and the topographic
									  map-derived DEMs. </p>
